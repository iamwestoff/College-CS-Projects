## Assignment Description

The final project for this course will require you to create an object-oriented Java application of your choosing. This is a great opportunity to add an impressive project to your resume. The requirements for the project are:
- You must meet with me to discuss your idea. After getting preliminary approval in our discussion you will write a short description of what the app will do and get my final approval. 
- The application must consist of several distinct classes. There should not be one large 'God' class that does everything. Use encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism as needed.
- The application must use Swing for the GUI. 
- The application must must use at least two design patterns (you can use any described in class or look here for more). If you use one pattern, but not two, there will be a penalty of 25%.
- You may not work together or select the same project as someone else. 
- You may not reuse a program or program idea from another class. 
 
The project will be graded on these criteria: 
- 50% program functions as discussed in our meetings.
- 25% program is a significant application. I will judge this based on my expectations of what can be accomplished in remaining weeks and working projects from others in class.
- 10% GUI interface design.
- 10% overall design.
- 5% code well commented and easy to read. 
 
I require that each person demonstrates their project to me on or before the due date. We will do this in an in-person meeting sometime before the end of the semester.
 
Past examples of final project programs include: 
- File Sharing Program (Composite and Proxy)
- Multiplayer Tetris (Observer and Singleton)
- Distributed Golf Score Keeper (Proxy and Observer)
- Texas Holdâ€™Em Poker (State and Proxy)

## Program of Choice Description
Using the state pattern, decorator pattern, and Observer pattern, I have created a two player pong Java GUI based game that aims to apply everything learned throughout the course, while adding a fun twist to the experience.

#### Some Errors Encountered
- Decorators applying but not applying to ball movement correctly
- Ball Reset sometimes breaks game and other windows
- Points scored do not always update accordingly
- States between observer windows aren't always updated correctly and in time with one another

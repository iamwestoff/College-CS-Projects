## Assignment Description
In assignment 3 you are given a partially completed Binary Search Tree class.
Functions to add:
  1. Returns the minimum value stored in the tree. (recursive)
  2. Prints the node values In Order (recursive)
  3. Prints the node values in Pre Order (recursive)
  4. Prints the node values in Post Order (recursive)
  5. Searches for a passed in element and returns true if found (recursive)
  6. Returns the height of the tree (recursive)

#### Balancing:

Once you have those functions added, you will need to add functionality to check that
the tree is balanced when you insert or remove an element. If it is not balanced you will
need to balance the subtree that is unbalanced. Take a look back at the slides!
Note: Your functions should print out when they are inserting, removing, or
rebalancing. Your search function should print out how many nodes were
checked to find the data that was passed into the function.

### Computer Science Classes
- Data Structures and Algorithms
    - This class aimed to teach students rewarding techniques to make programming and coding a less demanding, time-consuming, and "frustrating" process. This class aims to take all ideas learned throughout CS1 and CS2 and apply them to object-oriented techniques, structured programming, debugging, etc.
        - Language(s): `C++`
     
- Object Oriented Programming
    - This class aimed to further discuss object-oriented programming ideas, which include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, design techniques, and patterns. Instead of using C++, students were introduced to using Java to learn the rich Java API and develop a framework for Graphical User Interfaces.
        - Language(s): `Java`

- Computer Organization
    - This class taught students to understand the most low-level programming of aarch64 ARM-based Linux/MacOS assembly language. This class focused on memory management on a bit-to-byte level to encourage students to account for memory conversation and knowledge when applying to higher level languages.
        - Language(s): `Assembly` `C` `C++`

- Software Design and Development
    - Class used to teach students about the software design and development process, which includes the idea creation, team collaboration, Software Requirements Specification (SRS) creation, and actual development of a desired application or program in a group of 2-4 students.
        - Language(s): `C#` `C++` `HTML` 

- Database and Design
    - Class that aims to teach students a basic level of databases through ER Diagrams and Schemas and translate them to databases using SQL and DBBrowser for SQLite. Then, utilizing these databases with HTML and Python (Flask) to access and acquire data.
      - Language(s): `SQL` `Python` `HTML`
     
- Data Science
    - Using R and its libraries, students discover the baseline ideas of datascience to parse data, create graphs, and organize data through the use of RStudio. 
      - Language(s): `R`

### Other
- Game Development I
    - Language(s): `C#`
- Game Development II
    - Language(s): `C#`
- Game Development III
    - Language(s): `C#`
- Topics in Game Development
    - Language(s): `C#`
- Discrete Structures
